## Title: Vision-based activity recognition to optimize logistic processes
### Abstract: Activity recognition has been an active field of research in computer vision and artificial intelligence due to the fact that information about the environment can be abstracted from temporal information or series of events. Although this research has been more widely applied to human activities, it can also be used to understand and document logistics processes. In this work, we explore how to use the state-of-the-art methods in activity recognition into the processes of a waste management plant in order to optimize them and also boost the performance of other computer vision software modules by signaling the appropriate time sequences to analyze
